Welcome fellow user of the internet. I believe that we are all now quite familiar with the fact that websites track us. I, Oscar Zhou, promise that we will not collect your data unless it is for ads. Remember this - data collection sounds scary, but the truth is, it's not. We, developers, incoorpate 'data collection' to improve your life. We do it by showing you ads that you may actually find useful. I believe that you would much rather look at ads that you can relate to rather than an ad that doesn't make sense to you. Trust me, there are governments out there protecting you. Now, I hope you have a great time browsing the possibilities of the internet - as always, have a great day.
Oscar Zhou
